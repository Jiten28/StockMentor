## Overview
StockMentor simplifies stock market analysis for investors, especially beginners, by providing:

**StockMentor** is an AI-powered platform designed to simplify stock market analysis for new investors. It provides real-time stock data and analytics, machine learning-powered predictions using LSTM neural networks, and personalized investment tips. Users can create watchlists, set alerts, and access educational resources to understand stock dynamics better. By offering data-driven insights and easy-to-understand tools, StockMentor helps investors make informed decisions and navigate the complexities of the stock market with confidence. The platform aims to bridge the knowledge gap, promoting financial literacy and empowering users to make smarter investment choices.

### **Key Features**
- **Real-Time Stock Data and Analytics**: Using `pandas_datareader` to fetch live stock prices and other related data.
- **Machine Learning-Powered Predictions**: LSTM models built with `tensorflow` for predicting stock trends.
- **Personalized Investment Tips**: Based on the LSTM predictions, you can develop a recommendation system.
- **Watchlists and Alerts**: Users can set alerts for specific stock price changes.
- **Educational Resources**: Articles or video tutorials integrated into the platform for beginners.

### **Challenges**
- **Accuracy amidst Data Volatility**: Stock markets are unpredictable, so ensuring that your models remain accurate under changing market conditions will be crucial. You may want to implement regular model updates or retraining schedules.
- **Promoting Financial Literacy**: You could include simple guides, glossary features, or explainers of machine learning models for users to understand what is driving predictions.

### **Future Enhancements**
- **Portfolio Management**: Allow users to track their investments in a portfolio, integrating various stocks' performances in a dashboard.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrate social media or news sentiment analysis to predict stock trends based on public opinion or news.
- **Social Features**: Enable collaboration, so users can share their watchlists, predictions, and tips with each other.

### **Python Version**
- Python 3.11.9 or higher.
  
### Steps to Start the Project:
1. **Data Collection**: Use `pandas_datareader` to fetch stock market data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Scale data using `MinMaxScaler` for input into the LSTM model.
3. **Model Building**: Build an LSTM model in `tensorflow` to predict stock trends.
4. **Evaluation**: Use `mean_squared_error` to assess model performance.
5. **Visualization**: Plot predictions and trends using `matplotlib`.
